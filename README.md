# creating remote branch

firstly we made repo on github
-> get the github link
-> go to local pc and mkdir -> cd to that dir and git init
-> git init
-> git remote add origin <github link>
-> git pull origin master
-> git checkout -b <branch name>
-> git push origin <branch name>
edit: git remote add origin <url> instead of just git remote add <url> (edited)
